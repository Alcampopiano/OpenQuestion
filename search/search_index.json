Survey data and share links can also be accessed from the dashboard. Clicking \"New survey\" or the :pencil: icon will take you to the survey designer (explained below) for a new or existing survey, respectively. The survey dashboard Survey designer \u00b6 The survey designer is where most of the survey development takes place. It consists of the designer toolbar (click on the :wrench: to toggle the side panel's visibility) and various other UI elements, including those that allow you to structure your survey and control how it behaves. To preview the survey as the end user would see it, click \"Preview\" at the top of the page (or access the share link from the dashboard). The survey designer Designer toolbar \u00b6 The designer toolbar contains widgets (e.g., text_box, drop_down, sections, etc). Clicking on the widgets adds them to the page below the currently selected element. The :wrench: icon will toggle the toolbar's visibility. The designer toolbar Widget settings \u00b6 When a widget is added to the page during survey development, values need to be specified to control how the widget appears to the end user. For example, the text_box widget (as shown above) requires the following information: title For example, \"What is your name?\" placeholder text that prompts the user. For example, \"Type your name here?\" mandatory flag if checked, this field must be filled out by the user before the survey can be submitted number if checked, this field will be restricted to a number All widgets have their own sets of options to be specified.

In fact, all survey settings are represented by an underlying and accessible JSON/Python dict where keys and values corresspond exactly to what is shown in the designer Widget toolbar \u00b6 Once a widget has been added to the page, the widget's toolbar can be used to move the widget up or down, delete the widget, and control the widget's visibility with branching . The widget toolbar Basic Widget controls \u00b6 The :minus: sign can be used to delete the widget and the up/down arrows can be used to move the widget up or down. Branching \u00b6 The :git: icon opens up the branching UI. Branching controls the visibility of the selected widgets (including sections) based on the values of other widgets. Multiple conditions can be combined together to make complex branching rules if needed. The below example shows a text_box widget's visibility being controlled by the value of a slider widget. In this case, whenever the slider goes below 40, the text_box is displayed. When branching exists on a widget, the :git: icon on the widget's toolbar is highlighted.
