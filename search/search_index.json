Clicking \"New survey\" or the icon will take you to the survey designer (explained below) for a new or existing survey, respectively. The survey dashboard Survey designer \u00b6 The survey designer is where most of the survey development takes place. It consists of the designer toolbar (click on the to toggle the side panel's visibility) and various other UI elements, including those that allow you to structure your survey and control how it behaves. To preview the survey as the end user would see it, click \"Preview\" at the top of the page (or access the share link from the dashboard). The survey designer Designer toolbar \u00b6 The designer toolbar contains widgets (e.g., text_box, drop_down, sections, etc). Clicking on the widgets adds them to the page below the currently selected element. The icon will toggle the toolbar's visibility. The designer toolbar Widget settings \u00b6 When a widget is added to the page during survey development, values need to be specified to control how the widget appears to the end user. For example, the text_box widget requires the following information: title For example, \"What is your name?\" placeholder text that prompts the user. For example, \"Type your name here?\" mandatory flag if checked, this field must be filled out by the user before the survey can be submitted number if checked, this field will be restricted to a number The following example shows the designer representation of the text_box as well as what the end user sees: in the designer shown to the user All widgets have their own sets of options to be specified.

Multiple conditions can be combined together to make complex branching rules if needed. The below example shows a text_box widget's visibility being controlled by the value of a slider widget. In this case, whenever the slider goes below 40, the text_box is displayed. When branching exists on a widget, the icon on the widget's toolbar is highlighted.
